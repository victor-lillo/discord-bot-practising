### ``Success ranking``
Based on sharing tweets (mentioning a tw account) in a specific channel.

### ``DMs``
Reply with a DM.

### ``NFT collection rarity access``
Based on the result of the other repos [solanart-rarity-calculator](https://github.com/fentosv/solanart-rarity-calculator) and [opensea-rarity-calculator](https://github.com/fentosv/opensea-rarity-calculator).
