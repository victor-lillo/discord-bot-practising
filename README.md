## Usage

* Fill ``.env`` with settings.
* Set up the login info tokens in ``config.json``.
* Run it.

## Features

### ``Success ranking``
Based on sharing tweets (mentioning a tw account) in a specific channel.

### ``DMs``
Reply with a DM.

### ``NFT collection rarity access``
Based on the result of the other repos [solanart-rarity-calculator](https://github.com/victor-lillo/solanart-rarity-calculator) and [opensea-rarity-calculator](https://github.com/victor-lillo/opensea-rarity-calculator).
You can ask for

* **rank** ``!rank collectionSlug rankNumber`` - Returns the NFT ranked in the desired position.
* **top** ``!top collectionSlug rank[100 | 10% | 1-10]`` - Returns the X first positioned NFT in the rarity rank from a collection.
